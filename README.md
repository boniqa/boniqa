### Hi there ~ <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="24px" alt="hi">

I'm Weronika – a product-minded software developer and creative technologist who loves building meaningful digital products.

🔍 Currently exploring new opportunities in tech with a focus on health and well-being.  
💡 Passionate about user-driven design, product strategy, and writing clean, scalable code.  
🛠️ I enjoy working across the stack and across teams — from business goals and product-market fit, to wireframes and commits.  
🌍 Based in Oslo, working globally.  
🎯 On a mission to build things that matter.
